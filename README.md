## Local installation

Pay your attention that the project is designed to run on Cloudflare Workers. It requires additional steps to run it via Cloudflare Workers preview or deploy to the production environment.

The steps below are for local development only for the quick start and check.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)
  
### Steps

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:besidka/besidka.git
```

Go to the project directory. Install the dependencies.

```bash
cd besidka
bun install
```

Copy wrangler and ENV related files.
```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
cp wrangler.jsonc.example wrangler.jsonc
```

Generate environment types for the project.
```bash
bun run cf-typegen
```

Prepare drizzle migrations.
```bash
# Expected output is .drizzle/migrations/*.sql
bun run db:generate
```

Apply the migrations to the D1 database.
```bash
# Expected output is .wrangler/state/v3/d1/*.sqlite
bunx wrangler d1 migrations apply besidka
```

Start the development server.
```bash
bun run dev
```

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
2. Sign up [http://localhost:3000/signup](http://localhost:3000/signup). Please use the Email + Password flow because you don't have prepared API keys for Google and GitHub OAuth yet. In development mode you don't need to wait for email confirmation. You have to be automatically redirected to the home page as a customer already.
3. Put your own API keys here: [http://localhost:3000/profile/keys](http://localhost:3000/profile/keys)
4. You are welcome to start a new chat: [http://localhost:3000/chats/new](http://localhost:3000/chats/new)
